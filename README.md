TRANSPORT
=========

# transport

This is the begining of Transport, a program that creates free improvisation music.

This program is written in Clojure and uses the Overtone library. Overtone requires the synthesis library Supercollider

## Installation

Download from github.com

## Usage

To try the current version.

1. Install this software with it's dependencies.
2. Start the application by opening a terminal window ad cd to the directory where transport is installed
3. At the terminal prompt type lein REPL
4. If you use the REPL, at this time you can start playing but will not be able to stop due to status information being printed to the console.
5. To be able to start ad stop from the terminal, open an new terminal window (or tab), cd to the transport directory nad at the terminal prompt enter lein repl :connect <port REPL is running in other terminal window>
6. Enter transport commands in the new terminal window
7. If you connect to the REPL using Emacs, you can start and stop from Emacs nrepl
8. In the clojure REPL or the Emacs nrepl:
9. make sure you are in the transport.core namespace - (ns transport.core)
10. (transport-start)
11. You should then hear notes being played.
12. (transport-pause) in Emacs nrepl to stop playing notes - after all scheduled notes are played.
13. To restart use either (transport-restart) or (transport-start) in Emacs nrepl
14. (transport-help) to see instructions

## Options

transport-start command has a keyword arg :num-players to set the number of players.
For example (transport-start :num-players 15) to use 15 players.
If num-players is not set it will default to 10.
